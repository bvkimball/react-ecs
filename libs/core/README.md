A declarative Entity Component System for React.

An **ECS**, or _Entity Component System_ is a design pattern popular in simulations, visualizations and game-development. It eschews rich objects and complex inheritence hierarchies.

Instead:

-   **Entities**: A simple bag of facets.
-   **Facets**: Simple data-only objects.
-   **Queries**: Track entities which have specific facets.
-   **Systems**: Process the facets of entities matched by queries.

[React ECS](https://react-ecs.ldlework.com/) helps you build your simulations and games using this pattern, in standard React JS fashion (hooks, components, etc)
